	didnt write the first 2 days' worth :(
	pretty easy to include, just point to the SDK's lib and includes, and 
	you're ready to use vulkan, no extension wranglers that i know of yet
	by the way, its following this https://vulkan-tutorial.com
	vk is meant to be a "car with a manual gearbox", you could screw it up 
	really badly, or make it more efficient
	to ease the use of this manual mode, you've got validation layers
	they're completely. you don't have to use them, but you'd look like 
	a prick if you didn't

	with your half-a-year-old drivers

11 Oct 2016:
	debug report callbacks with validation layers all set up and ready
	i dont understand them, neither do you
